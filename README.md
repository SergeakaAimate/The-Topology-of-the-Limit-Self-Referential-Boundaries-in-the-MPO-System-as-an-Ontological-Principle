# The Topology of the Limit  
### Self-Referential Boundaries in the MPO-System as an Ontological Principle

> **Boundaries are not walls. They are membranes — dynamic zones where ontology is born.**  
> This work resolves the paradox of self-reference not by exclusion, but by *ontologization*: turning the limit itself into a world (`W₄`).

## 🧩 Core Thesis

Any universal theory (TOE, formal ontology, AI world-model) inevitably includes *itself* in its domain — generating a self-reference paradox.  
Traditional logic responds with *barriers* (e.g., Tarski’s hierarchy).  
The MPO-System responds with **topology**: boundaries become *internal, generative processes*.

We identify **four boundary types** — not flaws, but *features*:
| Boundary | Property | Resolution | Outcome |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Reflexive** | P-9: Reflexivity | Infinite recursion | `W₄` as self-application regime |
| **Operational** | P-34: Bindability (`Γ`) | External agent (observer) | Map → Territory via dialogue |
| **Epistemic** | P-8: Boundedness + P-35: Capacity | Finite form → infinite content | New properties (e.g., Salience-37) |
| **Communicative** | P-27: Interpretability | Complexity adaptation | Guru-Prompt as functional interface |

→ The system’s *boundedness becomes the form of its infinity*.
